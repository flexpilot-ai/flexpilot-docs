# Configuring Cohere Models

This page explains how to retrieve or generate API credentials for Cohere models. Once you have the configuration details, you can follow the guide [here](/docs/configuration/chat.md#setting-up-your-model) to set up the model in the Flexpilot IDE.

## Setup Guide

::: warning üîí Security Warning
Never commit API keys to version control or share them publicly. Keep them secure!
:::

1. Login to Cohere [Dashboard](https://dashboard.cohere.com) or sign up for a new account if you don't have one.
2. Navigate to Cohere Dashboard [API Keys](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys) section to create a new API key.
3. Click `+ New Trial key` and give it a descriptive name (recommended).
4. Once you create the API key, copy it immediately as it won't be visible again.
5. Visit the Cohere [Models](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models) documentation to select the appropriate model for your needs.

## Configuration Reference

Use these settings when configuring Cohere in Flexpilot IDE:

::: details ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Fields {open}
| Field | Description | Default/Recommended |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| API URL | Base endpoint URL | `https://api.cohere.com/v2` |
| API Key | Your secret key | From [API Keys](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys) |
| Model ID | Model identifier | `command` |
| Temperature | Response creativity (0-1) | `0.2` for code generation |
| Tool Calling | Function calling support | `true` |
:::

::: tip üí° Best Practices
- Use lower temperatures (0.1-0.3) for more deterministic code generation
- The default API URL works for most users - only change if using a proxy
