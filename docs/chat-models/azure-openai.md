2. Request access to Azure OpenAI service if you haven't already.
3. Create an Azure OpenAI resource in your desired region.
4. Deploy your chosen model through Azure OpenAI Studio.
5. Retrieve the API key and endpoint from the resource's "Keys and Endpoint" section.

## Configuration Reference

Use these settings when configuring Azure OpenAI in Flexpilot IDE:

::: details Configuration Fields {open}
| Field | Description | Default/Recommended |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| API Base URL | Base endpoint URL | `https://{resourceName}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deploymentId}` |
| API Key | Your secret key | From Azure Portal |
| Model ID | Deployment identifier | Your deployment name |
| Temperature | Response creativity (0-1) | `0.2` for code generation |
| Tool Calling | Function calling support | `true` |
:::

::: tip ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
- Use lower temperatures (0.1-0.3) for more deterministic code generation
- Make sure to replace {resourceName} and {deploymentId} in the API URL with your actual values
- Create separate deployments for different model versions if needed
