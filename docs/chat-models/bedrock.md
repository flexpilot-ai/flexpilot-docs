# Configuring AWS Bedrock Models

This page explains how to retrieve or generate API credentials for AWS Bedrock models. Once you have the configuration details, you can follow the guide [here](/docs/configuration/chat.md#setting-up-your-model) to set up the model in the Flexpilot IDE.

## Setup Guide

::: warning ðŸ”’ Security Warning
Never commit AWS credentials to version control or share them publicly. Keep them secure!
:::

1. Login to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) or create a new account if you don't have one.
2. Navigate to IAM Console to create a new IAM user with Bedrock access permissions.
3. Generate Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for the IAM user.
4. Enable AWS Bedrock service in your desired region.
5. Visit the Bedrock [Models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html) documentation to select the appropriate model.
